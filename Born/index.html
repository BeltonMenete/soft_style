        <h2>The basic Soft Style of the web</h2>
        <p>
            All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS
            and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
        </p>

        <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

        <h3>What is Soft Style (aka HTML)?</h3>
        <p>
            HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
            <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the
            content of a webpage (not a programming language).
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images,
            video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>

        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts</p>

        The opening tag The closing tag The actual element
